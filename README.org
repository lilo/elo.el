* Elosort
** Overview
Elosort  is an  Emacs extension  that helps  you to  sort a  set which
elements aren't sortable with "usual" commutative comparison.

The extension associates  an Elo-rating for each element  and lets you
set a  "competition" between  elements. You pick  a "winner"  from the
given pair and Elosort updates the ratings accordingly.

** Installation
Create org-mode file containing a list of elements.

#+begin_src org :eval no
* apple
* orange
* banana
* grape
* pear
* lemon
#+end_src


Start the competition with ~elosort-fight~.
See the scoreboard with ~elosort-list-top~.

** Notes
Finally you can compare apples and oranges!

Number of comparisons required for calculating adequate rating list is
proportional to square of the number of elements.
